/**
 * Lambda entry point for the dedicated MCP API Gateway on mcp.<domain>.
 *
 * Serves the OAuth Protected Resource Metadata (PRM) document, a Bearer 401
 * challenge, and the Streamable HTTP `/mcp` transport that exposes the single
 * `sql` tool. Every `/mcp` request must carry an OAuth Bearer access token,
 * which resolves to a connection (user + selected workspace) before the MCP
 * server runs.
 *
 * The canonical MCP resource is `https://mcp.<domain>/mcp` (no `/v1` stage
 * prefix), and the authorization server lives on `https://auth.<domain>`.
 *
 * Routes are mounted at both `/` and `/v1`, mirroring the auth app
 * (apps/auth/src/app.ts): custom-domain traffic on `mcp.<domain>` arrives
 * without a stage prefix, while the raw execute-api invoke URL delivers the
 * `/v1` stage name in the request path.
