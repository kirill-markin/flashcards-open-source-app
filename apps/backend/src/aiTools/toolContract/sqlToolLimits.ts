/**
 * Maximum serialized size (in UTF-16 code units, i.e. JS string length) of the
 * agent envelope a single agent SQL tool/endpoint result is emitted in.
 *
 * Reads reject a payload above this budget; writes are already committed when
 * the payload is measured, so they shrink instead of failing: they shorten the
 * echoed statement text when that makes the emitted payload smaller, then drop
 * the returned rows if the payload is still over budget.
 *
 * The MCP directory caps a tool result at roughly 25k tokens. The row-count
 * limits above (100 rows, 50 statements) do not bound serialized size: 100
 * cards with long markdown `back_text` can still overflow that token budget.
 *
 * Sizing: using a conservative ~4 chars/token heuristic, 25k tokens is ~100k
 * chars. We target well under that to leave headroom for tokenization that runs
 * hotter than 4 chars/token on dense JSON/markdown. 48,000 chars (~12k tokens
 * at 4 chars/token) is a safe round number that stays comfortably below the
 * directory limit.
