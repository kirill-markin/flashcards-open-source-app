# iOS Local Setup

## After cloning

Create your machine-local iOS config file:

```bash
cp apps/ios/Flashcards/Config/Local.xcconfig.example apps/ios/Flashcards/Config/Local.xcconfig
```

`Local.xcconfig` is gitignored and must be filled on each machine that builds the iOS app.

If you want local signed archives to reuse the same values as Xcode Cloud, keep
the `XCODE_CLOUD_*` keys in the repo-root `.env` and regenerate
`Local.xcconfig` with:

```bash
sh apps/ios/Flashcards/ci_scripts/ci_post_clone.sh
```

The script reads the same `XCODE_CLOUD_*` keys from Xcode Cloud workflow
environment variables in CI and from the local root `.env` outside Xcode Cloud.

## Required values

The app reads hosted service, observability, and legal/support values from `Local.xcconfig`.

```xcconfig
APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER = com.flashcards-open-source-app.app
API_BASE_URL = https:/$()/api.flashcards-open-source-app.com/v1
AUTH_BASE_URL = https:/$()/auth.flashcards-open-source-app.com
PRIVACY_POLICY_URL = https:/$()/flashcards-open-source-app.com/privacy/
TERMS_OF_SERVICE_URL = https:/$()/flashcards-open-source-app.com/terms/
SUPPORT_URL = https:/$()/flashcards-open-source-app.com/support/
SUPPORT_EMAIL_ADDRESS = kirill+flashcards@kirill-markin.com
FLASHCARDS_SENTRY_DSN =
FLASHCARDS_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT = local
FLASHCARDS_SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE = 0.0
```

Add `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM` when you need to run on a physical device or create signed archives:

```xcconfig
DEVELOPMENT_TEAM = ABCDE12345
```

Important: Xcode `.xcconfig` treats `//` as a comment, so URL values must use `https:/$()/...` instead of literal `https://...`.

## Xcode Cloud

Set the same values in the Xcode Cloud workflow environment. These values are mandatory for Xcode Cloud builds of the iOS app:

- `XCODE_CLOUD_DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`
- `XCODE_CLOUD_APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`
- `XCODE_CLOUD_API_BASE_URL`
- `XCODE_CLOUD_AUTH_BASE_URL`
- `XCODE_CLOUD_PRIVACY_POLICY_URL`
- `XCODE_CLOUD_TERMS_OF_SERVICE_URL`
- `XCODE_CLOUD_SUPPORT_URL`
- `XCODE_CLOUD_SUPPORT_EMAIL_ADDRESS`
- `XCODE_CLOUD_SENTRY_DSN` (secure workflow value; do not commit the real DSN)

Signed archive workflows must also define the Sentry debug-file upload values:

- `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN` (secure secret)
- `SENTRY_ORG`
- `SENTRY_IOS_PROJECT`

Optional Sentry values:

- `XCODE_CLOUD_SENTRY_ENVIRONMENT` (defaults to `production` in Xcode Cloud and `local` outside it)
- `XCODE_CLOUD_SENTRY_TRACES_SAMPLE_RATE` (defaults to `0.0`)
- `SENTRY_URL` (only needed for a non-default Sentry endpoint; the URL must match the endpoint that issued `SENTRY_AUTH_TOKEN`)

`apps/ios/Flashcards/ci_scripts/ci_post_clone.sh` writes those values into the generated `Config/Local.xcconfig` file during Xcode Cloud builds.
The same script can be run locally and will read the repo-root `.env` when those
keys are present there. `apps/ios/Flashcards/ci_scripts/ci_post_xcodebuild.sh`
reads Sentry upload values from Xcode Cloud, or from the repo-root `.env.sentry`
and `.env` outside Xcode Cloud.

Xcode Cloud builds now fail in `ci_post_clone.sh` before `xcodebuild` starts if any required build-time value is missing or if any URL value does not start with `https:/$()/`. Archives fail in `ci_post_xcodebuild.sh` if any required Sentry upload value is missing, if `sentry-cli` cannot be downloaded, or if its checksum does not match.

`SENTRY_CLI_EXPECTED_SHA256` is an optional non-secret override for the pinned `sentry-cli` binary checksum. Set it only when intentionally bumping the pinned CLI version.

The human-operated iOS release gate is documented in [`docs/ios-ci-cd.md`](ios-ci-cd.md).

If Xcode Cloud should pin the live smoke flow to the standard review account explicitly, also set:

- `FLASHCARDS_LIVE_REVIEW_EMAIL=apple-review@example.com`

`FLASHCARDS_LIVE_REVIEW_EMAIL` remains optional.

## Local App Store archive

Xcode Cloud remains the canonical iOS release path, but a local signed archive can
be used when Xcode Cloud is unavailable or when an urgent manual upload is needed.

Before creating a local App Store archive:

1. Regenerate `apps/ios/Flashcards/Config/Local.xcconfig` from the repo-root `.env`:

```bash
sh apps/ios/Flashcards/ci_scripts/ci_post_clone.sh
```

2. Make sure the local values match the intended Xcode Cloud release values,
including at least:

- `DEVELOPMENT_TEAM`
- `APP_BUNDLE_IDENTIFIER`
- `API_BASE_URL`
- `AUTH_BASE_URL`
- `PRIVACY_POLICY_URL`
- `TERMS_OF_SERVICE_URL`
- `SUPPORT_URL`
- `SUPPORT_EMAIL_ADDRESS`

3. Set a local-only iOS build number override in
`apps/ios/Flashcards/Config/Local.xcconfig` with `APP_CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION`.

The local signed build number must be higher than the latest relevant build number
that could conflict in App Store Connect, including queued or recently uploaded
Xcode Cloud builds for the same app version.

Example local override:

```xcconfig
APP_CURRENT_PROJECT_VERSION = 204
```

The repository default build number in `Base.xcconfig` is only a stable fallback.
Do not treat it as the signed release build number.

Archive and export example:

```bash
xcodebuild \
  -project "apps/ios/Flashcards/Flashcards Open Source App.xcodeproj" \
  -scheme "Flashcards Open Source App" \
  -configuration Release \
  -derivedDataPath "tmp/ios-derived-data" \
  -destination "generic/platform=iOS" \
  -archivePath "tmp/ios-archives/Flashcards-Review.xcarchive" \
  -allowProvisioningUpdates \
  archive
```

Manual `xcodebuild archive` does not run Xcode Cloud post-build hooks. Before
exporting the archive, upload the archive dSYMs with the same hook Xcode Cloud
runs automatically:

```bash
CI_ARCHIVE_PATH="tmp/ios-archives/Flashcards-Review.xcarchive" \
  sh apps/ios/Flashcards/ci_scripts/ci_post_xcodebuild.sh
```

Export example:

```bash
xcodebuild \
  -exportArchive \
  -archivePath "tmp/ios-archives/Flashcards-Review.xcarchive" \
  -exportPath "tmp/ios-export" \
  -exportOptionsPlist "tmp/ios-export-options-app-store-connect.plist" \
  -allowProvisioningUpdates
```

Use `method = app-store-connect` in the export options plist for App Store Connect
distribution.

## Local Testing Rules

The iOS Xcode project is file-synchronized, so new Swift files can be added without manual `project.pbxproj` edits.
Running iOS simulator-backed tests and local smoke flows is resource-heavy in this repository, so do not run `xcodebuild test`, XCUITest, screenshot-generation, or local smoke flows reflexively after every edit.
When a simulator-backed run genuinely helps validate a change, run it: choose the narrowest iOS simulator run that validates the change, and avoid broad iOS test runs without a clear reason.
iOS full test runs can take a bit more than 2 minutes locally, and that is normal.
Run on one specific iPhone simulator runtime that is already downloaded locally.
Prefer an already booted local iPhone simulator on the final supported iOS runtime. Reuse that exact device instead of booting a different one when possible.
Prefer the background CLI flow over opening heavy Xcode UI: `xcrun simctl bootstatus`, then `xcodebuild test`.
Do not open a visible iOS Simulator window for test runs unless the user explicitly asks for a visible simulator at that time.
Pass `-derivedDataPath "tmp/ios-derived-data"` for local CLI builds and tests so repeated runs reuse repo-local build artifacts instead of creating new global DerivedData directories.
If an iOS test fails, inspect the generated `.xcresult` bundle and read the relevant screenshots, attachments, and logs before changing code.
If a suitable simulator is already warmed, keep using it and avoid rebuilding unnecessarily.
If no suitable local iPhone simulator runtime is already available, downloading one is slow and large, so tell the user before starting that download.
For iOS, `My Mac` can be used only for iOS compile smoke-checks such as `build` or `build-for-testing`, not as a reliable destination for app-hosted unit tests.
Preferred local CLI examples:

```bash
xcrun simctl list devices available
xcrun simctl bootstatus <device-uuid> -b
xcodebuild -project "apps/ios/Flashcards/Flashcards Open Source App.xcodeproj" -scheme "Flashcards Open Source App" -derivedDataPath "tmp/ios-derived-data" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=<device-uuid>' test
xcodebuild -project "apps/ios/Flashcards/Flashcards Open Source App.xcodeproj" -scheme "Flashcards Open Source App" -derivedDataPath "tmp/ios-derived-data" -destination 'platform=iOS Simulator,id=<device-uuid>' -only-testing:'Flashcards Open Source App UI Tests/LiveSmokeSettingsTests/testLiveSmokeLocalNavigationFlow' test
```
