# Managed Media Cross-Client Smoke

Use this manual smoke when a release changes managed image authoring, upload,
download, rendering, or workspace sync behavior. Keep the scope to image-only
managed media; audio and video are outside this checklist.

## Setup

- Use one production-like account and one shared workspace on Web, iOS, and
  Android.
- Use a small PNG or JPEG that is visually easy to recognize on every client.
- Start each destination client online, signed in, and able to sync the shared
  workspace.

## Checklist

For each path, create a new card on the source client with ordinary front/back
text and one image attachment that renders as a managed `fcasset:` reference.

| Source | Destination checks |
| --- | --- |
| Web | Sync iOS and Android, open the card, and confirm both render the image. |
| iOS | Sync Web and Android, open the card, and confirm both render the image. |
| Android | Sync Web and iOS, open the card, and confirm both render the image. |

Expected behavior for every path:

- The source client may save the card text locally before the image upload
  finishes.
- The source client eventually uploads the image through the managed media
  upload queue and completes the S3-backed media asset.
- Destination clients receive the card and logical media asset through sync,
  download the image bytes through the managed media download path, and render
  the image after sync/download completes.
- Destination clients must not remain permanently stuck on unavailable media
  after the source upload has completed and sync has run.

## iOS Card Photo Picker Regression

Run this flow on a real iPhone:

1. Open Cards, tap Add card, and open Front.
2. Enter ordinary text, tap Add image, and select a recognizable photo.
3. Confirm the Front editor remains visible after the system photo picker closes,
   the original text remains present, and the selected image appears in the
   preview strip.
4. Use Back to return to the card form; this must not save or dismiss the card.
   Open Back, enter ordinary answer text, return to the card form, and tap Save.
5. Confirm the new card is visible in Cards, reopen it, open Front, and confirm
   the text and image are still present.

Repeat the picker portion with each of these conditions:

- Tap Cancel in the system photo picker. The Front editor and enclosing card
  editor must remain open and unchanged.
- Select an animated GIF. The actionable rejection alert must appear, and
  closing it must leave the Front editor and enclosing card editor open with
  the existing text unchanged.
- Select JPEG- and HEIC-origin photos, including once while the iPhone is
  offline. Each supported photo must be inserted locally while the Front editor
  and enclosing card editor remain open; upload may wait for connectivity.

## Failure Evidence

If any path fails, capture:

- source client and version/build
- destination client and version/build
- media asset id from the `fcasset:` reference
- card id, if visible in diagnostics or logs
- approximate timestamp and timezone
- whether the source client still shows a pending or failed upload state

## Generated Image Chat Tool

After this change is merged and deployed, make the next permitted real image request from a signed-in production chat:

- Explicitly request one teaching-relevant image and confirm the assistant
  inspects the card first and names the card and side.
- While background promotion is outstanding, inspect the requested side and
  confirm it contains exactly one pending marker:
  `![<alt>](fcasset:<mediaAssetId>?state=pending)`. Ordinary card text on both
  sides must remain unchanged.
- After promotion completes, sync Web, iOS, and Android. Confirm the same
  marker becomes `![<alt>](fcasset:<mediaAssetId>)`, the image renders
  everywhere, and no answer-revealing content appears on the front.
- Confirm the pending and ready writes each appear as card hot-sync changes
  with the generated operation metadata. The media asset registration and
  query-free card marker must become durable in the same promotion
  transaction.
- Do not make additional real image requests for ceiling, retry, replay,
  cancellation, claim-loss, guest, or terminal-failure checks. Use the
  deployed automated Postgres integration result and structured promotion-job
  logs to confirm that retries retain `?state=pending`, terminal failures
  change a still-present marker to `?state=failed`, access revocation performs
  the same transition, and guest chat stays SQL-only.
- For failure evidence without another paid image request, use the automated
  fixture's deterministic staged bytes and correlate the promotion `jobId`,
  `workspaceId`, terminal `errorCode`, and outcome in structured logs. Confirm
  the corresponding card hot-change record and failed marker; do not inject a
  production failure or replay a provider request.
- Record only model/status/request ID/duration and card/media IDs, never prompts, alt text, image bytes/base64, signed URLs, storage keys, or tool output.

### Generation ceilings

Three independent ceilings apply to one generated-image request. The per-run
ceiling is checked first, and between the two windows the monthly one is checked
and reported first, because its reset is never earlier:

- Per run: attempts inside one assistant turn, reserved one at a time and
  derived from the operations already stored on that run's assistant item
  (`apps/backend/src/chat/runs/generatedImageAttemptRepository.ts`), so a failed
  attempt counts. Exhaustion answers the model with `limit_reached`.
- Per workspace sync replica, per UTC day.
- Per workspace, per UTC calendar month.

The two window ceilings and their numbers live in
`apps/backend/src/chat/cardImages/generationBudget.ts`. Exhausting either raises
`GENERATED_CARD_IMAGE_GENERATION_LIMIT_REACHED`, carrying which ceiling was hit,
its limit, and when the window resets. Both windows are UTC wall-clock and do
not depend on the session TimeZone. They count promotion jobs, which exist only
once a generation has been staged, so a paid generation that never reached
staging is uncounted and concurrent operations in one scope can end past a
limit. The grant that lets the runtime read those timestamps is
`db/migrations/0135_generated_media_promotion_job_created_at_select.sql`, whose
header explains why no index accompanies it.

A card that was deleted between the model reading it and the request reaching
the backend comes back as the `card_not_found` tool result instead of failing
the turn; the identical 404 raised after the provider was paid still fails the
run. See [agent tool surfaces](agent-tool-surfaces.md#error-codes-a-caller-can-receive).
