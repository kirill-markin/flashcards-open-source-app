-- Migration status: Current / canonical.
-- Replaces or corrects: analytics.probable_scraper_fleet_visitors from
-- db/migrations/0226_probable_scraper_fleet_worldwide_rule.sql, with the same name, columns, unique
-- index, grants and readers.
-- Current guidance: 0226's rule, with its arms A to D and its webdriver path unchanged, except that
--   site_page_engaged counts among the passive events of the one-page history test, for actors and
--   daily visitor hashes alike. A subject whose whole history is one site_page_viewed plus passive
--   impressions and that page's site_page_engaged is marked when its page view meets an arm. A
--   second page view or any other site event still keeps a subject out of the arms.
-- Schemas touched/read explicitly: analytics.
-- See also: db/migrations/0226_probable_scraper_fleet_worldwide_rule.sql for the arms and their
-- evidence, apps/backend/src/productAnalytics/catalog.ts for site_page_engaged,
-- apps/backend/src/entrypoints/scheduledJobs/lambda-probable-android-burst-refresh.ts,
-- docs/analytics-audience.md.

-- site_page_engaged is the marketing site's report that a page was read rather than only loaded: at
-- most once per page view, after the page has been visible for 10 seconds in total and the visitor
-- scrolled, moved or pressed a pointer, touched, or pressed a key on it. It is neither a second
-- page nor a click. The site began sending it on 2026-10-19 at about 21:00 UTC, and 0226, which
-- lists only the impressions as passive, then let it alone keep a one-page subject unmarked: in
-- about the 19 hours that followed, 17 actors with a single page view that met arm D, a Chrome
-- User-Agent without a matching Chromium hint, escaped the view through it, because fleet clients
-- of that kind stay on the page past the event's threshold and interact before they leave. A
-- one-page reader who meets an arm was marked before the event existed, so this rule is no
-- stricter than 0226 was for visits before the site sent it.
--
-- Refreshed as 0223 says, so the next refresh re-marks history under this rule. Nothing is deleted.
