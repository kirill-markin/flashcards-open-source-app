// Reservation-based accounting for the six main application pools below. The synth guard does
// not bound all connections to Postgres: secondary pools, other functions and idle connections in
// retained Lambda environments also draw from the database.
//
// The db.t4g.small instance has 181 connections, with 3 reserved for superusers: 178 usable.
// Main-pool allocation: (12 + 6 + 16 + 16 + 3 + 2) x 3 = 165, leaving 13 for additional draw.
// Every budgeted function receives DB_POOL_MAX_CONNECTIONS from here; the backend and auth pool
// constructors enforce it in apps/backend/src/database/core.ts and apps/auth/src/db.ts.
//
// Additional draw is not included in the synth guard:
// - Secondary pools: session advisory locks (max 2), product analytics (max 4), and reporting
//   (max 4) per environment that opens them. MCP sql_execute and submit_review reach the analytics
//   writer after the main transaction commits; releasing that client does not close its connection.
// - WebGuestReaperHandler, CommunityLeaderboardSnapshotHandler, StreakLeaderboardSnapshotHandler,
//   ProgressActiveDaysBackfillHandler, ProbableAndroidBurstRefreshHandler,
//   MultipartCompletionReconciliationHandler and GeneratedMediaPromotionHandler use the main pool without reserved concurrency. Schedules are
//   not serialization: the two media jobs run every minute with two-minute timeouts, and retries
//   or additional invocations can overlap. The reaper and active-days backfill also use reporting.
// - CatalogDumpHandler has reservation 1 but its main pool is outside this sum.
//   GlobalMetricsSnapshotHandler uses reporting; its freshness checker reads S3, not Postgres.
//   DbMigrationHandler uses a separate owner connection.
//
// The remaining 13 connections do not cover simultaneous saturation of these additional pools.
// Reservation increases require observed database headroom and post-deploy monitoring; they do
// not guarantee a whole-fleet worst case or eliminate throttling when demand exceeds a reservation.
